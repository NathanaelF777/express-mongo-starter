# express-mongo-starter

This is a bug tracking app built with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap as a project for the second unit of my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive.

The idea was to experiment with data relations in MongoDB. Currently still a work in progress.

Features:
Individual user accounts,
Ability to track items on a per project bases,
Ability to invite and join users to projects to allow for collaboration.

App deployed to Heroku: https://coin-express-mongo-example.herokuapp.com
